biferno-RDBMS is an SQL-enabled RDBMS implemented in Biferno script
it is an architectonical derivative of PHP TXTDBAPI (aka 'flatfiledb')
http://www.c-worker.ch/txtdbapi/index_eng.php

It has a good degree of support for SQL-92 / SQL-99.

The Biferno version is re-factored to take advantage of application scope for code and variables, as well as persistent variable storage for backup and transactional functionality. It is also dramatically faster and competitive with SQLite.
A basic object to relational mapping is also currently in the works.
